##############################
# 1) There are some variables:

availableCoffee <- 1000  # in grams
neededForEspresso <- 7    

# Using the variables, calculate how much coffee you need for a 6 espressos?

coffee6espressos <- 6*7
coffee6espressos

# How many espressos you get from the available coffee? 

howmanycoffees <- 1000 / 7
howmanycoffees

##############################
# 2) There is some data about a fictional research group:
#

month <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
coffeeConsumption <- c(8, 6, 4, 5, 7, 9, 7, 7, 10, 6, 7, 7) # in kilograms
articlesSubmitted <- c(2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 4, 1, 0, 0, 2)

# Check that all the vectors are of equal length. Use function length. 

length(month)
length(coffeeConsumption)
length(articlesSubmitted)
# tai jos haluaa hienostella:

identical(length(month),
          length(coffeeConsumption),
          length(articlesSubmitted))

# Learn to use function mean:
# What are the average coffee consumption and the average number of articles submitted?

mean(coffeeConsumption) # On average, the group consumes 6.9 kilograms of coffee / month
mean(articlesSubmitted) # On average, the group submits 0.9 articles / month

# Learn to use function sum:
# Calculate the average coffee consumption without the function mean, using only 
# functions sum and length, and the variable coffeeConsumption. 

sum(coffeeConsumption) / length(coffeeConsumption)

# Does this produce results that are identical to those obtained using the function "mean"?

identical(mean(coffeeConsumption),(sum(coffeeConsumption) / length(coffeeConsumption)))

# What happens if you try to give the vector month to the function mean?

mean(month)
# Does not work on character vectors
typeof(month)

#################################### Please note! ########################################################################
# Above, when calculating sum(coffeeConsumption) / length(coffeeConsumption) the 
# calculation worked because the vectors were of equal lengths. But what if they aren't? Let's try:

v1 <- c(1,2,3,4)
v2 <- c(6,7)
v1*v2
#[1]  6 14 18 28
v3 <- c(8,9,10)
v1*v3
#[1]  8 18 30 32
#Warning message:
#  In v1 * v3 :
#  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length

# So we see that in the case of vectorized computation, R implicitly recycles the shorter vector, in some cases 
# without notifying the user of this!!!

###############################
# 3) Create a data frame of the vectors above and assing it to a variable named "coffee"

coffee <- data.frame(month,coffeeConsumption,articlesSubmitted)

# View the data frame you created.

coffee
View(coffee)

###############################
# 4) Calculate a new variable "espressos" to the data frame, which describes how may espressos the 
# research group consumed per month. Please use the previously defined variable 
# neededForEspresso. 

##### This method of solving the problem works but should be avoided. I will explain below why this is so.

coffee$espressos <- (coffeeConsumption*1000)/neededForEspresso
coffee

# This method should be avoided because it's error-prone. Now the dataframe and our environment (think desktop)
# both contain the variables "month", "coffeeConsumption" and "articlesSubmitted" and above, I'm creating a new
# variable into the dataframe based on the variables "running free" in the environment. It would be better to 
# do the calculations based on the variables already in the dataframe. To be sure, let's remove the variables
# from the environment (we can always re-create them easily if needed): 

rm(month,coffeeConsumption,articlesSubmitted)

# You can now see the above command doesn't work anymore:

(coffeeConsumption*1000)/neededForEspresso

# So let's do the same operation based on the variables in the dataframe:

coffee$espressos <- (coffee$coffeeConsumption*1000)/neededForEspresso

###############################
# 5) Load package psych. Install it if needed. Use command install.packages("psych)

install.packages("psych")
library(psych)

# Use its function describe to show some describe statistics about the data frame coffee.

describe(coffee)

# What was the skew and kurtosis of the variable "espressos"?

# skew: 0.12, i.e. right tail is slightly longer than the left; kurtosis: -0.61, i.e. slightly light-tailed distribution

hist(coffee$espressos) #well...

#############################
# 6) Learn to use function cor for calculation correlations. 


# What is Pearson's correlation of articles submitted and coffee consumption?

cor(coffee$articlesSubmitted,coffee$coffeeConsumption)

# What is Spearman's correlation of articles submitted and coffee consumption?

cor(coffee$articlesSubmitted,coffee$coffeeConsumption,method = "spearman")

# Hmmm, why the big difference?
plot(coffee$articlesSubmitted,coffee$coffeeConsumption)

#############################
# 7) Make the exercise 6 using with. If you already completed the exercise 6 using with,
# you can make this exercise without with. :)

with(coffee,cor(articlesSubmitted,coffeeConsumption))
with(coffee,cor(articlesSubmitted,coffeeConsumption, method="spearman"))

##############################
# 8) Make a copy of the data frame coffee to another variable, and change the names of the variables.
# You are free to invent you own names.

coffee2 <- coffee
names(coffee2) <- c("Petra", "Olli", "painii", "Riossa")
coffee2

#############################
# 9) Create missing values with function fix. Enter command fix(coffee).

fix(coffee)

# Fix can be useful if have small datasets and you need to make some small changes to the data
# interactively. However, remember that the changes are stored only to the data frame in your computer's
# memory. If you have loaded the data from file, the changes are not automatically saved, fortunately.
# I say fortunately, because editing with your data interactively is potentially a great error. 
# How to keep track of the changes you made? 

# Create a couple of missing values to variable coffeeConsumption. The cell should display NA. Then close the 
# editing window. 

# Try to calculate mean of the coffee consumption using function mean. What happens?

mean(coffee$coffeeConsumption) # NA is returned


# How you can use parameter na.rm to ignore the missing values? 

mean(coffee$coffeeConsumption,na.rm = TRUE)
