#####
# 1) Load dataset sleep from the R dataset repository using command data(sleep).
#    Get accustomed to the data. 

data(sleep)
describe(sleep)
?sleep
str(sleep)
class(sleep$extra)
class(sleep$group)
class(sleep$ID)
?typeof
typeof(sleep$extra)
typeof(sleep$group)
typeof(sleep$ID)


#####
# 2) Create different kinds of plots, using both boxplot and ggplot2, to describe the
# differences between the two drugs. 

boxplot(extra~group,sleep)
plot(sleep$extra,sleep$group)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = sleep, aes(x = group, y = extra)) + geom_boxplot() # boxplot
ggplot(data = sleep, aes(x = group, y = extra)) + geom_point() # scatterplot
ggplot(data = sleep, aes(x = group, y = extra)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point() # boxplot and scatterplot

# I'll construct two histograms to compare the drugs, but I'll do it in a piecemeal fashion
# First the basic histogram
ggplot(data = sleep, aes(extra)) + geom_histogram()
# Adjust appearance a bit:
ggplot(data = sleep, aes(extra)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=.8)
# Make it look nicer:
ggplot(data = sleep, aes(extra)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=.8,color="black", fill="white")
# Compare groups:
ggplot(data = sleep, aes(x=extra,fill=group)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=2,alpha=.3, position="identity")
# This looks a bit silly because there are so few observations. The idea of plotting overlaid histograms is nice, though.


######
# 3) Test the difference between the two drugs to extra hours of sleep using 
# Student's paired t-test.

# What was the syntax again..?
?t.test

# How similar are the variances?
ddply(sleep,.(group), summarize, SD = sd(extra)) # Pretty much so

t.test(sleep$extra~sleep$group, paired=TRUE, var.equal = TRUE)

### 
# 4) The data is in long format. Reshape the data to wide format, so the two observations
# from the same participant (denoted with variable group) are on their own variables. 

widesleep <- dcast(sleep,ID~group,value.var="extra") # Don't forget the quotes!
widesleep


###
# 5) Create a scatter plot where the extra hours for drug 1 are on the x-axis, and
# the extra hours for drug 2 are on the y-axis. 

# I need to rename the columns of the new dataset first:
names(widesleep)[2:3] <- paste("drug",sep="",1:2)
names(widesleep)

# Then I can produce the basic scatterplot
ggplot(widesleep, aes(x=drug1,y=drug2)) + geom_point()

# Or fine-tune it a bit, fooling around with colors:
ggplot(widesleep, aes(x=drug1,y=drug2)) + geom_point(color="#FF33FF",size=3) + theme_light()

# Or see who is where based on subject ID:
ggplot(widesleep, aes(x=drug1,y=drug2, label=ID)) + geom_text(size=5)

# Or fit a regression line to the plot:
ggplot(widesleep, aes(x=drug1,y=drug2)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm,se=FALSE)


####
# 6) Load the game data from file kr_gameraw.txt. 

gameraw <- read.table("kr_gameraw.txt",header=TRUE)
head(gameraw)

# Calculate the accuracy of responses for each participant. See the lecture notes (rmANOVA.html) 
# how to calculate it. 

accuracy <- ddply(gameraw, .(player_id), summarize, 
                  Phit = mean(hit),
                  Pcorrej = mean(correctRejection),
                  accuracy = Phit + Pcorrej)
                  
head(accuracy)

####
# 7) Make a plot which describes the level of accuracy by age group and gender. 
# Run ANOVA 2 x 2 to investigate if there are differences in accuracy as a function of age group or gender, 
# weather there is interaction of age group and gender?
head(gameraw)

# Let's produce another data set with the accuracy, age group and gender variables

gameacc <- ddply(gameraw, .(player_id), mutate,
                 Phit = mean(hit),
                 Pcorrej = mean(correctRejection),
                 accuracy = Phit + Pcorrej)
head(gameacc)

gameacc <- gameacc[-c(3:9,11,12)] 
gameacc <- unique(gameacc)

temp <- ddply(gameraw, .(player_id), mutate,
                 Phit = mean(hit),
                 Pcorrej = mean(correctRejection),
                 accuracy = Phit + Pcorrej)
head(gameacc)

# Let's produce a barplot:
ggplot(gameacc, aes(x=age_grp,y=accuracy,fill=gender)) + geom_bar(position=position_dodge(), stat="identity") +
      scale_x_discrete(labels=c("Adult", "Child")) + xlab("Age group") + guides(fill=guide_legend(title=NULL))

# The y-axis scale isn't all that useful, but setting ylim(.5,.9) won't work: if in bargraphs the lower bound isn't
# zero, the bar won't be drawn at all!

# And a boxplot:

ggplot(gameacc, aes(x=age_grp,y=accuracy,fill=gender)) + geom_boxplot() +
      scale_x_discrete(labels=c("Adult", "Child")) + xlab("Age group") + guides(fill=guide_legend(title=NULL))

# Let's calculate the ANOVA using the car package:

library(car)

model.acc <- lm(accuracy ~ age_grp*gender, data=gameacc)

# This produces the same result:
model.acc2 <- aov(accuracy ~ age_grp*gender, data=gameacc)

summary(model.acc)
summary(model.acc2)

Anova(model.acc,type=3)
Anova(model.acc2,type=3)

# This is also one way to calculate type III Sums of Squares:
drop1(model.acc,~.,test="F") 

# There are only differences between the two age groups, no interaction and no effect of gender

####
# 8) In the lecture notes the game was divided into three sets, and then we investigated learning effects 
# over the course of the game. Perform a repeates measures ANOVA to investigate whether gender has 
# an effect on learning. This means that you need to investigate the interaction of set and gender. 

gameraw$set <- recode(gameraw$video_id,"0:9=1; 10:19=2; 20:29=3")
gameraw$set <- ordered(gameraw$set)
aggredata <- ddply(gameraw, .(age_grp, player_id, set,gender), summarize,
                Phit = mean(hit),
                PcorrectRejection = mean(correctRejection),
                accuracy = Phit + PcorrectRejection)

# 9) Refresh your memories from previous statistics courses. 
# Is everything all right with the repeated measures ANOVA you just performed? 
# Are we breaking any assumptions?

# Perhpas it would be good to check the variance-covariance matrix of the three conditions to see 
# how we're doing with the sphericity assumption:

# Create a wide version of the data with the variable accuracy:
temp <- dcast(aggredata, player_id ~ set, value.var = "accuracy")

# give the variables better names:
names(temp) <- c("player_id", paste("set", sep="", 1:3))

# get rid of the unnecessary id-variable:
temp$player_id <- NULL

# calculate the variance-covariance matrix:
cov(temp)

# Using the correlation metric shows that the three conditions are indeed correlated:

cor(temp)
